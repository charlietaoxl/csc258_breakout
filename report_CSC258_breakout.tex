\begin{enumerate}

    \item Which milestones were implemented? 
    1, 2

    \item How to view the game:
    % TODO: specify the pixes/unit, width and height of 
    %       your game, etc.  NOTE: list these details in
    %       the header of your breakout.asm file too!
    
    \begin{enumerate}

\section{Attribution Table}
% TODO: If you worked in partners, tell us who was 
%       responsible for which features. Some reweighting 
%       might be possible in cases where one group member
%       deserves extra credit for the work they put in.

% TODO: Fill out the remainder of the document as you see

%       necessary to better understand your code. 
%       You can add extra sections and subsections to 
%       help us understand why you deserve marks for 
%       features that were more challenging than they
%       might initially seem.
